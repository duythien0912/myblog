1
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,500
Yeah

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,240
EVERGLOW

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,240
Hit the drums Pa rum pum-pum-pum-pum-pum

4
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,160
Go ahead and sing Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la

5
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,400
I’m going in fierce from the start

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Don’t be shocked

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,500
I’m spreading by word of mouth

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,180
They say that kid that just passed by isn’t average

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,400
This deep jungle is just a thrilling playground to me

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,980
Alright I’ve chosen

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,460
nananananana

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,900
I’ll leave my name in that heart of yours

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,800
So, You had better run

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,620
You are so done--

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,100
You are so done

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
Now you're done

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,300
Trapped in my light (Dun! Dun!)

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,160
Like a young lamb

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,880
Dun--

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Baby you’ll be frozen

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,100
I’m more fearless than I look so strong

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,560
Don’t let down your guard or I’ll flip the tables

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,900
bomb, the bomb

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,160
I’ll dominate in a flash and leave you breathless

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,000
Talking cool but my gestures are hot like uh

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,260
Elegantly now I won't stop, can't stop I’m aiming for you

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,640
Even if you run it’s a deserted island

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,140
Alright it’s all over

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,420
nananananana

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,800
I’ll leave my image in that heart of yours

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,560
So, You had better run

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,840
You are so done--

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,720
Now you're done--

34
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,620
Trapped in my gaze (Dun! Dun!)

35
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,620
Like a young lamb

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,820
Dun--

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,060
Baby you’ll be frozen

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,780
Deeper and deeper I’ll dig into you

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,740
Clutching to the end without a doubt

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,560
Hail me (you’ll stare)

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,920
Shout my name (you’ll call)

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,360
That’s right (you’re mine)

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
I’ve seen right through you

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,000
You are so done--

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,880
You are so done--

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,180
Now you're done--

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,600
Trapped in my gaze (Dun! Dun!)

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,820
Like a young lamb

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Dun--

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,120
Baby you’ll be frozen

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,240
(Dun! Dun!)

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,800
(Dun! Dun!)

53
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,600
Baby you’ll be frozen
